Getting_and_cleaning_Data
==========================

Created this repository for the course project

The code takes for granted all the data is present in the same folder, un-compressed and without names altered.
The folder structure is as follows:
Root directory contains the files 'run_analysis.R', 'activity_labels.txt', 'averages_data.txt', 'features.txt', 'test' folder, 'train' folder.

CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file.

The output of the 5th step is called averages_data.txt, and uploaded in the course project's form
